teri khusboo aur teri sanse katra katra sab bhulayenge
silwate jo tumne chhori hai dhire dhire sab mitayenge

katane ko itni lambi umr aage hai 
jane kiske pichhe tu bewajah bhagi hai

aankh nam hoti hai hone do hoth lekin muskurayenge
uski raton se subah apni rafta rafta khich layenge

chal nayi suruaat kar bhul se jo ho gaya 
hath pe yu hath kya rakhna 
hoooo
teri khusboo aur teri sanse katra katra sab bhulayenge
silwate jo tumne chhori hai dhire dhire sab mitayenge
